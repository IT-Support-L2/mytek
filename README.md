### Support this project through Sponsor button to make this project N1 Ecommerce Django model so that all Django students will have top notch Ecommerce project model to follow and to learn from. This project needs time and monthly charges to pay to keep it optimized, updated and running.  For sure I am helpful but `CI/CD Thank you` does not pays the monthly charges.
